Remaining Issues/Questions:

* We are inconsistent with regards to lowerCamelCase versus CapitalizedCamelCase. For example: the "Country" fields -- they should all probably be "country". But there are many more.
* Although I think I was able to get pnpm test:unit --filter @nexeraprotocol/vc-issuer-polygon-id to run locally, I see that there are some hardcoded "dev" env props. Is this OK? It does not work from vc-issuer-polygon-id folder.
* References to narrow-types in envToBranch in packages/libs/schemas/src/compliance/vc-schemas/vc-utils.ts will have to be changed back to development before we merge with development.
* narrow-types branch on vc-schemas will need to merge with development before chore/narrow-types branch on NexeraID is merged. Also the version should be bumped to whatever the proper version number should be.  Is there somewhere the version number needs to be set in NexeraID?
* faceMatchScore really seems like it should be a number. currently it is a string.
* Why are ProcessedDocuments not defined in schema for idscan?
* download-schema:* needs to be set back to development from narrow-types

            }
      }

    note that with base 64 defined this way, we no longer would need a document type.
    question - do we want any of the following types:

      "image/gif": Used for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images.
      "image/bmp": Used for Bitmap (BMP) images.
      "image/webp": Used for WebP images, a modern image format developed by Google.
      "image/svg+xml": Used for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images.
