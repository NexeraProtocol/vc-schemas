Fields Still to Alter / Add Possibly in the Future

    documentType: "image/jpeg" | "image/png" |??
    base64: {
            "type": "string",
            "media": {
                "binaryEncoding": "base64",
                "type": ["image/png", "image/jpeg"],
            }
      }

    note that with base 64 defined this way, we no longer would need a document type.
    question - do we want any of the following types:

      "image/gif": Used for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images.
      "image/bmp": Used for Bitmap (BMP) images.
      "image/webp": Used for WebP images, a modern image format developed by Google.
      "image/svg+xml": Used for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images.

  faceMatchScore -- seems like this should be a number.
